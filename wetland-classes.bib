ABSTRACT={Due to climatic constraints in dryland regions, wetlands usually occur at confluences of flow paths, whether from surface flow, inter-flow or at locations of groundwater discharge. Long-term landscape processes that shape valleys and focus the movement of water and sediment are accountable for providing a suitable template with which hydrology interacts to allow wetland formation. Current hydrogeomorphic classification systems do not address system-scale linkages of sediment and water transport across the landscape, and are therefore unable to contextualise long-term process dynamics. Misunderstanding long-term earth system processes can result in the application of inappropriate restoration strategies that isolate wetlands from longitudinal drivers of their formation. We propose a genetic classification system that focuses on the mode of wetland formation, and is based on the understanding that genetic processes impact on the outcome hydrology, sedimentology, geomorphology, ecosystem service provision, and long-term dynamics of wetlands in drylands. The classification aims to impart understanding of dynamic processes of sediment transport through wetlands, such that restoration plans can be sensitive to long-term landscape processes. The classification system, derived from a combination of international literature and published South African case studies, has four wetland macrotypes based on sediment source (colluvial, alluvial, Aeolian, and geochemical). These are subdivided into eight wetland types; hillslope seep, floodplain, valley-bottom, plain, blocked-valley, alluvial fan, aeolian depression, and geochemical depression. The classification is based on landscape location, shape, and the occurrence of geomorphic characteristics indicative of process.}

ABSTRACT={Wetlands can be classified by methods that range from the use of commonly recognized vegetation or cover types, to systems based on hydrology, geomorphology, or some combination of the two. The classification presented here is based on the hydrogeomorphic functions of wetlands. There are three basic properties that are used to provide insight into wetland functions: 1. Geomorphic setting-The three categories are depressional, riverine, and fringe. Extensive peatlands constitute a separate category because of their unique topographic and hydrologic conditions. Depressional wetlands can be open or closed to surface flows, and can be tightly or loosely connected to groundwater flows. Riverine wetlands range from those associated with steep to low gradient streams and are represented by floodplains. Fringe wetlands are sea level or lake level controlled. Peat lands normally initiate their development in depressions. If peat lands develop beyond the original depression, they can create their own unique geomorphic settings. Each of these four types roughly corresponds with limited combinations of water sources and hydrodynamic conditions.}
