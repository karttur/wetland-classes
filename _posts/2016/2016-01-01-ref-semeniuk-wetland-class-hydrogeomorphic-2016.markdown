General article on Hydrogeomorphic Systems, with focus on Brinson (1993) and Brinson and Malvarez (2002).

Brinson and Malvarez (2002) recognize seven classes defined from hydrologic characteristics and geomorphic position:
- DEPRESSIONAL
- RIVERINE
- MINERAL SOIL WET FLATS
- ORGANIC SOIL WET FLATS
- ESTUARINE (TIDAL FRINGE)
- LACUSTRINE (LACUSTRINE FRINGE)
- SLOPES

The scheme by Brinson and Malvarez (2002) was expanded by the US dept of Ag (I have the article), including adding subclasses.

##### TG comment

The seven classes can not be defined from the same biophysical properties, a range of different properties are required. Thus I am not that happy with the system. But it is perhaps still the
