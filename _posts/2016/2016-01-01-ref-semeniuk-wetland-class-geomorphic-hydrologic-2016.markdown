abstract: "The geomorphic-hydrologic classification treats wetlands as wet landforms, with wetlands being defined as "areas of permanently, seasonally, or intermittently waterlogged to inundated soils, sediments, or land, whether natural or artificial, fresh to saline" without recourse to identifying the vegetation type that may inhabit them. Water, through its geological/geomorphic, hydrological, and biotic interactions also drives biological productivity resulting in these wet landforms being inhabited by mosses, sedges, reeds, rushes, heaths, and forests. In the geomorphic-hydrologic classification, wetlands are separated into two fundamentally different types: 1. terrain-conforming, occurring in hollows and channels, covering plains/flats, and residing on vales, slopes, cliffs, and hill-tops; these may generate wetland sedimentary deposits, or they may simply be wetted land surfaces without any sedimentary deposits; and 2. self-emergent wetlands whose deposits accrete and rise into mounds above the land surface. Based on landform type and water regime 22 non-genetic primary categories of terrain-conforming wetlands are recognised which can be further subdivided by using descriptors such as size, shape, water salinity, vegetation cover, amongst others. Self-emergent wetlands can be differentiated into several types based on the composition of their accretionary material. The objective of the geomorphic-hydrologic wetland classification is to capture the global range of wetland types, and to base the classification and its associated descriptors on a hierarchical and systematic treatment of the two fundamental factors which determine the existence of wetlands: Land and water."

The starting point of the Geomorphologic-Hydrologic classification is a simplified land + water based classification. Combining the mineral landform and its (water related) filling. Two main classes are recognized:

1. Terrain conforming
2. Self-emergent

The Geomorphologic-Hydrologic system recognizes seven basic landforms:

- basin,
- vale,
- channel,
- plain (flat)
- slope
- cliff (wall)
- mont

I am not fond of these, cliff for instance is a kind of slope, saddle point is missing, and only one type of vale. The forms are not mathematically defined, at least not in this paper.

And five different water regimes:
- Permanent inundation
- Seasonal inundation
- Intermittent inundation
- Permanent waterlogging
- Seasonal waterlogging

Combining the basic landforms and the water regimes, the Geomorphologic-Hydrologic system identifies 22 different primary categories of wetlands. The labeling is esoteric, Wittgenstein would not have liked it.

a further problem of the Geomorphologic-Hydrologic is that it is the mineral bedding that determines the landform, and without ground penetrating observations, this can not be determined.

The article then goes on to discuss all kinds of stuff.

Good illustrations of landforms.
