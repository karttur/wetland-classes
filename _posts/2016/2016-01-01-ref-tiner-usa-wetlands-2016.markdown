How the US tries to extend the Cowardin classification system with Brinsons geomorphic schemas.

### LLWW

The geomorphic characteristics LLWW, stands for:

- landscape position,
- landform,
- water flow path and
- waterbody type

##### Landscape position

Position relative to a water body (not __the__ water body _per se_?):
- marine
- estuatine
- lotic
- lentic
- terrene

These are, in my mind, not landscape positions, but juxtapositions vis-a-vis lateral water sources. I think the term is misleading. In my classification schema I call this property __juxtaposition__

##### Landform

Physical shape of wetlands.

- basin
- flat
- floodplain
- fringe
- island
- slope
- peatland

This is a mixture of textural and contextural landforms. I do not think they are well defined. In my classification schema the two properies __textural__ and __contextural__ are used for these properties.

##### Water flow

Defines the direction of flow of water associated with the wetland.

- outflow
- throughflow
- inflow
- vertical flow
- bidirectional non-tidal
- groundwater-connected
- tidal (5 subclasses)

These properties can not be captured by on a pixel scale, but requires a thematic classification. Instead the water balance of each cell is defined, and in my classification this is then divided into __water source__ and __water fluctuation__.

##### Water body type

Just listed, not elaborated in the above article.
