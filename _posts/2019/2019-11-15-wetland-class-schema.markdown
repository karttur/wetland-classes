## Reviews and overviews of different approaches

| system | flora | soil text | soilchem | genesis | watersrc | waterfluct |  textural | contextural | juxtapos |
| Cowardin | prim |  | |  |  |  | |   |  |

| Geo-hyd | addon | addon | addon |  | addon | prim | prim | addon | addon |

The Cowardin, RAMSAR and Canadian systems are rigid, at the other end of the scale is the Geo-hyd, where almost any character can be added. The HGM types (Brinson 1993, Smtiht 1995, Brinsons and Alwarez, 200?) represents a middle ground; defined by geomorphological setting, water source and hydrodynamics (lateral and vertical). Additional subclasses are encourgaed but restricted to adhere to landform, water surce and hydrodynamics. [USDA]() developed a system of sub-"classes" for HGM.

#### NWI-plus (US National Wetland Inventory plus)

keyreference: [Tiner, 2016](../ref-tiner-usa-wetlands-2016).

NWO-plus is a combination of Cowardin (NWI) and Brinsons geomorphological classification. The added characteristics include:

- landscape position (in here = juxtaposition),
- landform (in here divided between textural and contextural landform),
- water flow path (in here divided between water source and water fluctuation) and
- waterbody type (in here = juxtaposition )
