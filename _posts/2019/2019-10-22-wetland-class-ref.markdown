An attempt to identify different wetland classification systems.

## Reviews and overviews of different approaches

### Wikipedia

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland_classification) has a short note on Wetland classification.

### Wetland International (Frazier, 1996)

Frazier, S. 1996. An overview of the world's Ramsar sites. Wetlands International Publ.29. 58 p.
[Library availability](https://www.worldcat.org/title/overview-of-the-worlds-ramsar-sites/oclc/882896416)

Wetlands can generally be classified into five basic systems, namely: Lacustrine, Riverine, Palustrine, Marine and Estuarine (Frazier, 1996).

### Australia Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN)

The [Australia Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN)](http://www.auscover.org.au/about-us/tern/) have published an online  [review of wetland classifications](http://wiki.auscover.net.au/wiki/Wetland_Classification)

## Ramsar classification

[Strategic Framework and guidelines for the future development of the List of Wetlands of International Importance of the Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar, Iran, 1971)](https://www.ramsar.org/sites/default/files/documents/library/strategic_framework_rsis_en.pdf): Contains appendices with definitions, but unclear if this is the updated documents.

All of the above have links to the RAMSAR web-page but on that site I can not find the proper document!

To avoid the weak point of Cowardin et al’s classification system [see below], the Convention on Wetlands developed a new and more comprehensive wetland classification system (adopted in 1990 and modified in 1996) – the Ramsar Classification System for Wetland Type.

## United States Environmental Protection Agency

[Classification and Types of Wetlands](https://www.epa.gov/wetlands/classification-and-types-wetlands#marshes)

#### Cowardin (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)

One commonly used classification system for wetlands was developed by Cowardin and is described in [Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States](https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/documents/Classification-of-Wetlands-and-Deepwater-Habitats-of-the-United-States-2013.pdf). The Cowardin system is used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the National Wetlands Inventory. In this system, wetlands are classified by landscape position, vegetation cover and hydrologic regime. The Cowardin system includes five major wetland types: marine, tidal, lacustrine, palustrine and riverine.

#### U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Another common wetland classification system, used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, was developed by Brinson and is described in A Hydrogeomorphic [HGM] Classification for Wetlands.  As the title implies, wetlands are classified by their geomorphic setting, dominant water source (e.g. precipitation, groundwater or surface water) and hydrodynamics. The hydrogeomorphic (HGM) includes five major wetland types: riverine, slope depressional, flat and fringe.

An updated version of the HGM system is available for [US Department of Agriculture](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs143_010784.pdf).

A more recent review is by Semeniuk (\*2) [Wetland Classification: Hydrogeomorphic System](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-94-007-6172-8_331-1)

The book contains an outline of semi-hierarchical classification system for New Zealand wetlands.

## Australia

The Department of Environment and energy [Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia](http://www.environment.gov.au/water/wetlands/australian-wetlands-database/directory-important-wetlands) includes a classification system for wetlands, identifying 40 wetlands types divided in 3 main categroies:

http://www.environment.gov.au/water/wetlands/australian-wetlands-database/directory-important-wetlands

- A. Marine and Coastal Zone wetlands,
- B. Inland wetlands], and
- C. Human-made wetlands.

This system was agreed to by the then ANZECC Wetlands Network in 1994. It is based on that used by the Ramsar Convention in describing Wetlands of International Importance, but was modified slightly to suit the Australian situation in describing wetlands of national importance. The page linked above lists the 40 wetlands types.

## Canada

The [Canadian Wetland Classification System](http://www.wetlandpolicy.ca/canadian-wetland-classification-system) (National Wetlands Working Group 1997) is based on a hierarchical system, which includes (1) wetland class, (2) wetland form and (3) wetland type. The five wetland "classes" are differentiated by their developmental characteristics and the environment in which they exist. The five classes are: bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and shallow water. Some wetlands accumulate peat (partially-decomposed organic matter) and are called peatlands. Bogs and fens are the dominant peatland classes in Alberta, although some swamps and marshes can also accumulate peat. In contrast, shallow open water wetlands and many marshes and swamps do not accumulate peat.

Wetlands are classified for many purposes: (1) to provide common terminology to describe similarities and differences among wetlands, (2) to group them for scientific studies and comparison, (3) to provide the foundation for conducting wetland inventories that report on the status, trends, functions, and condition of wetlands in specific geographic areas, and (4) for their conservation, use, and management. The criteria used in classification usually depend on the field of the experts creating the system and the information needs of the user. Most classification systems developed for natural resource management have used several features to group wetlands into similar types. These features include vegetation, hydrology, water chemistry, soils/substrate, and geomorphology. There are two basic approaches to classification: horizontal and vertical. A horizontal classification system is a simple listing of a finite number of types based on a few major characteristics. A vertical system employs a hierarchical approach that begins with general characteristics and then further subdivides groups into smaller and smaller units. Several classification schemes are summarized in this article: the Ramsar multinational classification system, a regional modification for East Africa, wetland classifications from the United States, Canada, and New Zealand, a geomorphic approach to global wetland classification, and a hydrogeomorphic approach used in the United States.
