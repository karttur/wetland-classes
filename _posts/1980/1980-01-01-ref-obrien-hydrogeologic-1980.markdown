abstract: "Wetlands occur in a variety of geologic, hydrologic, and topographic settings and exhibit diverse hydrogeologic characteristics. A wetland is more than an organic mat ‚Äê it is an element in a larger hydrogeologic system. Three distinct but related effects of wetlands are: modifying the character of runoff from a basin, influencing the discharge/recharge relationship with the underlying aquifer, and effecting the potential for ground water development in a wetland dominated basin. An important goal of wetland research is to define the diverse roles that wetlands play in the regional hydrology and to define the geologic, hydrologic, and topographic factors that will allow meaningful distinctions among wetlands. Geologic and hydrologic factors include character and thickness of surficial materials; bedrock type; hydrologic position; permeability of organic layer; transmissivity, quality, and hydrologic connection of wetland related aquifers; ground water outflow; and depth of standing water. Topographic factors are position in the drainage basin, relative size, and absolute size of wetlands. A wetland classification to aid hydrologists and land use planners is proposed using selected factors involving hydrologic position, topographic position, and geologic type."
