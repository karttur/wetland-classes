abstract: "The Congo Basin is the world's third largest in size (~3.7 million km2), and second only to the Amazon River 26 in discharge (~ 40,200 m3 s! 1 annual average). However, the hydrological dynamics of seasonally Flooded 27 wetlands and Floodplains remains poorly quanti!ed. Here, we separate the Congo wetland into four 3°×3° 28 regions, and use remote sensing measurements (i.e., GRACE, satellite radar altimeter, GPCP, JERS-1, SRTM, 29 and MODIS) to estimate the amounts of water filling and draining from the Congo wetland, and to determine 30 the source of the water. We find that the amount of water annually filling and draining the Congo wetlands is 31 111 km3, which is about one-third the size of the water volumes found on the mainstem Amazon floodplain. 32 Based on amplitude comparisons among the water volume changes and timing comparisons among their 33 fluxes, we conclude that the local upland runoff is the main source of the Congo wetland water, not the fluvial 34 process of river-floodplain water exchange as in the Amazon. Our hydraulic analysis using altimeter measurements also supports our conclusion by demonstrating that water surface elevations in the wetlands 36 areconsistentlyhigherthantheadjacentriverwaterlevels.Ourresearchhighlightsdifferencesinthehydrology and hydrodynamics between the Congo wetland and the mainstem Amazon floodplain."
