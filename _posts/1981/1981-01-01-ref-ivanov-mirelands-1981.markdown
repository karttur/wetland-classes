abstract: "Discusses peat accumulation and mire formation as a geophysical process, the classification of mires, the hydrodynamics of mires, calculation of water exchange in mires by water balance methods, and calculations of the effects of reclamation and conversion on the stability of mire and lake-mire systems. The author's standpoint is that peatlands are most usefully considered as mire ecosystems developed originally from waterlogged patches of mineral terrain. Each type of mire develops under a particular groundwater regime, the flow of groundwater through the uppermost layer of peat acting as a regulator of the type of vegetation and peat formed."
