abstract: "Abstract"
review: "An extension of the Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) wetland classification system proposed by Birnsion (1993), Smith et al (1995) and Brinson and Malvarez (2002).

Â´It is important to note that in keeping with HGM principles, subclasses must be distinguished on the basis of morphological characteristics, water source, and/or hydrodynamics.

The core part of the article is examples on how to expand the 7 classes identified by Smith et al., 1995.

Even if sympathetic, it is difficult to use with the biophysical map data I have, while at the same time dis-allowing using data on e.g. climate or vegetation."
